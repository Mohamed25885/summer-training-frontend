# youth care
we're building a website to connect our youth care department with the studets to make it easier to announce social activities, like student union elections, Social solidarity, and Student services.

## tech stack
 - **ui/ux**

    using fegma to brainstorm and create a design inspired by our collage existing [official website](https://feng.bu.edu.eg/index.php/students/youth-care)

    ![figema design](./images/mainTemplate.png)
- **frontend**

    - using html5/css/bootstrap to create our prototype template to then be converted to ***blade templates*** because we're using server side rendring in the backend
    > in the backend will be discussed more further  
- **backend**

    - **database**
        
        using ***mysql*** 
    - **backend framework**

        using ***php/laravel*** to manage our server and connect to the database to do all CRUD operations on the blogs contents through the admin panal and as we said before we're using server rendering methodology to serve our dynamic webites to the user and the engine used as template is ***blade***
